# multimedia_conversion_presets
A collection of scripts for re-encoding existing media (mostly videos, and music) with various 'enhancements' hand-picked by me, for the simplicity and convenience of others and myself.

## Software Required (User):
- [FFMpeg](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases) (for pretty much everything encoding related)
- [MakeMKV](https://www.makemkv.com/download/) (for ripping DVDs and Blu-Rays)
- [AviSynth+](https://github.com/AviSynth/AviSynthPlus/releases/) (for scripting more advanced edits)
